## Technical Debt (v1.8.1 / v1.9.0)

### 1. üö® Monitoring Template Test Failures (CRITICAL - BLOCKS NPM PUBLISH)
**Issue:** 51 test failures in monitoring-template.test.ts + 2 in createUiDefinition.test.ts

**Impact:** 
- **Blocks npm publish for v1.8.0** (GitHub Actions workflow fails)
- v1.8.0 GitHub release published successfully but not on npm registry
- Users must install from GitHub: `npm install HOME-OFFICE-IMPROVEMENTS-LTD/azmp-plugin-vm#v1.8.0`

**Root Cause Analysis (Completed 27 Oct 2025):**
GitHub Actions workflow failed with detailed logs showing:

1. **monitoring-template.test.ts (49 failures):**
   - Tests expect `dataCollectionRuleConfig` in variables (not present)
   - Tests expect `dataSources`, `performanceCounters`, `syslog` (missing)
   - Tests expect VM insights extension resources (not implemented)
   - Tests expect enhanced diagnostic settings (simplified version exists)
   - **Conclusion:** Tests written for enhanced monitoring features not yet implemented

2. **createUiDefinition.test.ts (2 failures):**
   - Tests expect `uiDefinition.parameters.config.isWizard` (property missing)
   - Tests expect wizard steps structure (monitoring, costPerformance, highAvailability, disasterRecovery)
   - Tests expect specific output mappings referencing step names
   - **Conclusion:** Tests expect wizard-based UI structure not yet implemented

**Resolution Strategy for v1.8.1 (REQUIRED FOR NPM PUBLISH):**

**Phase 1: Fix Tests to Match Current Implementation (2-3 hours) - RECOMMENDED FIRST**
- [ ] Update monitoring-template.test.ts to match actual template generation
- [ ] Remove expectations for unimplemented features (data collection rules, VM insights)
- [ ] Update createUiDefinition.test.ts for current flat UI structure
- [ ] Ensure all 543 tests pass locally
- [ ] **Result:** Clean CI, can publish to npm

**Phase 2: Enhance Features (Optional for v1.9.0) (8-16 hours)**
- [ ] Implement data collection rules for Azure Monitor Agent
- [ ] Add VM insights extension resources
- [ ] Convert UI to wizard-based structure with steps
- [ ] Add enhanced diagnostic settings configuration
- [ ] **Result:** Feature parity with test expectations

**Action Items for v1.8.1 Release:**
- [ ] Run focused tests locally: `npm test -- monitoring-template.test.ts createUiDefinition.test.ts`
- [ ] Fix test expectations to match v1.8.0 implementation
- [ ] Verify full test suite passes: `npm test` (543/543 passing)
- [ ] Commit fixes: "test: align monitoring and UI tests with v1.8.0 implementation"
- [ ] Push and verify GitHub Actions workflow passes
- [ ] Create v1.8.1 release with clean CI
- [ ] Publish to npm successfully

## üéØ Trusted Launch Feature Completion

### Apply Stashed Trusted Launch Work
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Target Release:** v1.8.1 or v1.9.0  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 hours  
**Assigned:** TBD

**Current Status:**
Trusted Launch refinements are stashed in `stash@{0}`:
```bash
cd /home/msalsouri/Projects/azmp-plugin-vm
git stash list
# stash@{0}: On feature/v1.8.0: WIP: Trusted Launch template changes...
```

**Stash Contains:**
- Modified: `src/templates/mainTemplate.json.hbs`
  - Load balancer name fallback
  - Trusted Launch securityProfile
  - Public IP hostname/sshCommand outputs
- New files: `generate-templates.js`, `test-trusted-launch-config.json`
- Generated: `generated-deployment/` directory

**Decision Options:**

#### Option A: Apply and Release as v1.8.1
```bash
cd /home/msalsouri/Projects/azmp-plugin-vm

# Apply stash
git stash pop

# Review changes
git diff

# Test
npm run build
npm test
./test-phase2.sh

# If all tests pass:
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add Trusted Launch template refinements"
git push origin feature/v1.8.0
git tag -a v1.8.1 -m "Release v1.8.1: Trusted Launch enhancements"
git push origin v1.8.1
```

#### Option B: Create New Feature Branch
```bash
cd /home/msalsouri/Projects/azmp-plugin-vm

# Create new branch
git checkout -b feature/trusted-launch-enhancements
git stash pop

# Continue development
# Test thoroughly
# Create PR when ready
```

#### Option C: Include in v1.9.0
Keep stashed until next major feature release, combine with other improvements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All Trusted Launch changes applied
- [ ] Tests pass (including monitoring tests if fixed)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Templates generate correctly
- [ ] ARM-TTK validation passes
