## üîß Technical Debt - v1.8.1/v1.9.0

### Fix Monitoring Template Tests
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Target Release:** v1.8.1 or v1.9.0  
**Estimated Effort:** 4-8 hours  
**Assigned:** TBD

**Issue Details:**
- 51 test failures in `src/__tests__/monitoring-template.test.ts`
- All failures related to data collection rule configuration
- Does NOT impact Phase 2 automation functionality

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Review test expectations in `monitoring-template.test.ts`
2. Analyze actual template output vs expected output
3. Determine if tests need updating OR templates need fixing
4. Run focused test: `npm test -- monitoring-template.test.ts`

**Files to Review:**
- `src/__tests__/monitoring-template.test.ts` - Test expectations
- `src/templates/monitoring/*` - Template files (if they exist)
- Template generation logic - Find where monitoring resources are generated

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All 51 monitoring tests pass
- [ ] Full test suite passes (543/543)
- [ ] No regressions in other test areas
- [ ] Documentation updated if behavior changed

**Commands to Run:**
```bash
cd /home/msalsouri/Projects/azmp-plugin-vm

# Run monitoring tests specifically
npm test -- monitoring-template.test.ts

# Run full suite after fixes
npm test

# Run Phase 2 tests to ensure no regression
./test-phase2.sh
```
