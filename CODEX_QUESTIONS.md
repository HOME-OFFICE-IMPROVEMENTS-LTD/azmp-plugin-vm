**Context:**
- 104 existing helpers from Phases 1-2
- ~60 new helpers in Phase 3
- Existing user templates in production
- Helper naming collision risks

**Question:** How can we effectively test encryption, Trusted Launch, and Confidential Computing features in a development environment?

**Context:**
- Hardware-dependent features
- Attestation requirements
- Compliance validation

### 9. Azure REST API Mocking Strategy
**Question:** How should we implement stubbing/mocking of Azure REST endpoints and SDK calls so that extension dependency logic and installation validation can be tested offline without actual Azure deployments?

**Context:**
- 20+ extensions with Azure service dependencies
- Installation order validation requirements
- CI/CD pipeline testing needs
- Local development environment setup

### 10. Integration Test Coverage
**Question:** Given the complexity of our plugin (164+ helpers across 4 phases), what testing patterns would you recommend for ensuring integration stability?

**Context:**
- Current: 101 tests passing
- Target: ~160 tests with Phase 3
- Cross-module dependencies

## üöÄ Performance Optimization Questions

### 10. Template Generation Performance
**Question:** With 164+ Handlebars helpers and complex nested configurations, what optimization strategies should we implement to maintain fast template generation?

**Context:**
- ARM template complexity
- Helper execution time
- Memory usage considerations

### 11. Performance Observability & Instrumentation
**Question:** How should we instrument template generation time, CLI latency, and memory usage so we can measure and verify optimizations during Phase 3 development?

**Context:**
- Template generation with 164+ helpers
- CLI commands with growing datasets
- Need baseline metrics for optimization
- CI/CD performance regression detection

### 12. Bundle Size Management
**Question:** As we add more modules and helpers, what strategies should we use to manage the plugin bundle size and allow selective loading of features?

**Context:**
