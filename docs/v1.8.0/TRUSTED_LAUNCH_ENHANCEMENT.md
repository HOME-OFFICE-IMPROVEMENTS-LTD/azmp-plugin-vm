# Trusted Launch Security Enhancement - v1.8.0

## Overview

**Trusted Launch is now enabled by default** for all VM deployments through this Azure Marketplace Generator plugin. This enhancement significantly improves the security posture of deployed virtual machines by protecting against boot-level threats.

## What's New

### ðŸ”’ Default Trusted Launch Configuration

All VMs deployed using this template now include:

- **Secure Boot**: Protects against rootkits and bootkits by validating the boot chain
- **vTPM (Virtual Trusted Platform Module)**: Enables measured boot and secure storage of encryption keys
- **Security Type**: Set to `TrustedLaunch` by default

### ðŸ“‹ User Experience Improvements

- **Portal Information**: Added InfoBox in deployment wizard explaining Trusted Launch benefits
- **Transparency**: Users are informed about the security enhancement during deployment
- **No Action Required**: Trusted Launch is automatically enabled with recommended settings

## Technical Implementation

### ARM Template Changes

In `templates/mainTemplate.json.hbs` (line ~530):
```json
"securityProfile": {
  "securityType": "TrustedLaunch",
  "uefiSettings": {
    "secureBootEnabled": true,
    "vTpmEnabled": true
  }
}
```

### UI Definition Changes

In `templates/createUiDefinition.json.hbs` (line ~121):
```json
{
  "name": "trustedLaunchInfo",
  "type": "Microsoft.Common.InfoBox", 
  "visible": true,
  "options": {
    "icon": "Info",
    "text": "ðŸ”’ Trusted Launch is enabled by default for enhanced security..."
  }
}
```

## Security Benefits

1. **Boot Protection**: Prevents unauthorized code from running during system startup
2. **Integrity Measurement**: vTPM provides cryptographic evidence of system integrity
3. **Compliance Ready**: Meets requirements for various compliance frameworks
4. **Zero Configuration**: Works out-of-the-box with no user intervention needed

## Compatibility

- **VM Images**: Requires Generation 2 (Gen2) VM images (already configured in template)
- **VM Sizes**: Compatible with most Azure VM sizes that support Trusted Launch
- **Regions**: Available in all Azure regions that support Trusted Launch capability

## Impact Assessment

### âœ… Validated

- ARM-TTK validation: **32/32 tests passed**
- Azure CLI validation: **Successful**
- Live deployment: **Confirmed working**
- Template generation: **Fixtures updated**

### ðŸ”„ Verified Functionality

- VM boots successfully with Trusted Launch enabled
- securityType shows as "TrustedLaunch" in Azure Portal
- secureBootEnabled and vTpmEnabled both active
- No breaking changes to existing deployments

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Deployments
- **No Impact**: Existing VMs continue to operate normally
- **New Deployments**: Automatically get Trusted Launch protection
- **Upgrade Path**: Redeploy VMs to benefit from enhanced security

### For Partner Center Submissions
- **Certification**: Trusted Launch may accelerate marketplace certification
- **Marketing**: Highlight enhanced security in offering description  
- **Documentation**: Update marketplace listing to mention security improvements

## Testing Recommendations

When testing this enhanced template:

1. **Clean Environment**: Always use a fresh resource group for testing
2. **Verify Security**: Check VM properties in Azure Portal after deployment
3. **Functional Testing**: Ensure applications work correctly with Trusted Launch
4. **Documentation**: Update any deployment guides for downstream teams

## Next Steps

1. **Documentation Updates**: Inform downstream teams about the security enhancement
2. **Marketplace Submission**: Update Partner Center offering description
3. **Monitoring**: Consider adding security-focused monitoring rules
4. **Training**: Educate operations teams on Trusted Launch benefits
