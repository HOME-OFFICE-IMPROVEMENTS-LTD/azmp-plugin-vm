cd /home/msalsouri/Projects/azmp-plugin-vm

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile TypeScript
npm run build

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run Phase 2 E2E tests
./test-phase2.sh

# Expected output: All tests pass ✅
```

**If tests FAIL:**
- [ ] Review error messages
- [ ] Fix issues in code
- [ ] Re-run tests
- [ ] Do NOT proceed to release

**If tests PASS:**
- [ ] ✅ Mark this step complete
- [ ] Proceed to Step 2

### Step 2: Test azure-marketplace-generator

```bash
cd /home/msalsouri/Projects/azure-marketplace-generator

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile TypeScript
npm run build

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Expected output: All tests pass ✅
```

**If tests FAIL:**
- [ ] Review error messages
- [ ] Fix issues in code
- [ ] Re-run tests
- [ ] Do NOT proceed to release

**If tests PASS:**

## 🎯 Step 3: Trusted Launch Stash Decision

**Current stash in azmp-plugin-vm:**
```
stash@{0}: On feature/v1.8.0: WIP: Trusted Launch template changes and generator refactoring (Oct 26)
```

**Contains:**
- Modified: src/templates/mainTemplate.json.hbs
  - Load balancer fallback name
  - Trusted Launch securityProfile
  - Public IP hostname/sshCommand outputs
- New files: generate-templates.js, test-trusted-launch-config.json, generated-deployment/
- Deleted: Old planning docs, test snapshots

### Option A: Ship v1.8.0 WITHOUT Trusted Launch refinements (RECOMMENDED)

**Rationale:**
- Phase 1/2 automation is complete and tested
- Trusted Launch work can be separate feature release
- Cleaner release scope
- Faster to production

**Commands:**
```bash
cd /home/msalsouri/Projects/azmp-plugin-vm

# Leave stash as-is for future work
# Current feature/v1.8.0 is ready to ship

# Tag release
git tag -a v1.8.0 -m "Release v1.8.0: Recovery Services Vault automation with approval system"

# Push tag
git push origin v1.8.0

# Create PR: feature/v1.8.0 → develop → main
# Or merge directly if you own the repo
```

**Decision:** [ ] Choose this option

---

### Option B: Ship v1.8.0 WITH Trusted Launch refinements

**Rationale:**
- Include all template improvements in one release
- More comprehensive v1.8.0
- Requires additional testing

**Commands:**
```bash
cd /home/msalsouri/Projects/azmp-plugin-vm

# Apply stash
git stash pop

# Review changes
git status
git diff

# Test again
npm run build
npm test
./test-phase2.sh

# Commit if tests pass
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add Trusted Launch template refinements

- Add load balancer name fallback
- Add Trusted Launch security profile
- Add public IP telemetry outputs (hostname, sshCommand)
- Update generator and test configurations"

# Push changes
git push origin feature/v1.8.0

# Tag release
git tag -a v1.8.0 -m "Release v1.8.0: Automation + Trusted Launch enhancements"
git push origin v1.8.0
```

**Decision:** [ ] Choose this option

---

### Option C: Drop Trusted Launch stash (if obsolete)

**Commands:**
```bash
cd /home/msalsouri/Projects/azmp-plugin-vm

# Permanently delete stash
git stash drop stash@{0}

# Proceed with v1.8.0 as-is
git tag -a v1.8.0 -m "Release v1.8.0: Recovery Services Vault automation"
git push origin v1.8.0
```

**Decision:** [ ] Choose this option

---

## 📋 Step 4: Release Execution

```bash
# After tag is pushed, go to GitHub:
# https://github.com/HOME-OFFICE-IMPROVEMENTS-LTD/azmp-plugin-vm/releases/new

```

### 4.2 Merge to main (if using PR workflow)

```bash
# Create PR: feature/v1.8.0 → develop
# Then: develop → main
# Use prepared PR description from below
```

### 4.3 Publish to npm (if applicable)

```bash
