# Archived Helper Scripts

This directory contains one-off debugging and analysis scripts used during development. These scripts are kept for historical reference but are no longer actively maintained.

## Files

- `analyze-template.js` - Template structure analyzer (used during v1.x development)
- `debug-params.js` - Parameter debugging utility (used for troubleshooting)
- `fix-param-sync.js` - Parameter synchronization fixer (used during ARM-TTK remediation)

These scripts were instrumental during development but are no longer needed for the v2.1.0+ codebase.
